# a11y (accessibility) toolbar

## Goals
* Subtle, yet noticeable; easy to use
* Minimally "designed" so that anyone and everyone can and will want to use it on their site, blog, ecommerce, etc.
* Doesn't change existing site layout, but will enhance readability when used
* Semantic; assistive technology and keyboard accessible

## Changelog

0.1.0 10 Jun 2016
* Removed AFontGarde and Modernizr as they are no longer necessary
* Removed the skip links as they may conflict with existing skip links
* Converted CSS to Sass partials for easier inclusion
* Compiled Sass partials into a single CSS file
* Using body classes to control presentation rather than swapping in/out stylesheets
* Re-wrote JavaScript to be more modular and have better integration with AMD setups
